  "content": "There are many different types of reactor modules across the galaxy, including fission, fusion, anti-matter and more exotic technologies, but they all share the same objectives: to provide substantial amounts of energy to run a ship's systems, as well as allowing some of that energy to be stored. \n\nThese modules are self-contained and have enough safety measures in them to ensure that a ship won't suffer a catastrophic accident if the reactor is breached, but they should still be considered essential modules and kept well protected: a ship without energy cannot fire most weapons, or use its engines. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that the hyperspace core can generate its own energy, therefore allowing a ship to escape even in the event of otherwise total power loss."
