  "content": "Torpedo launchers sacrifice the ability to be mounted on a turret as well as a missile guidance system for a significantly increased payload size. The torpedoes launched completely ignore enemy shields and deal devastating kinetic damage, but are dumb-fire and require a highly skilled captain to be effective... or a very close range. \n\nWith the increased precession required, many captains reported the desire for an updated weapon system, allowing for a turreted torpedo launcher. The more advanced weapons manufacturers filled this gap in the arms market by producing shorter torpedoes with the same payload and high-quality synthetic fuels as well as a completely redesigned reloading system, allowing for the launcher to be mounted on a turret. \n\nDespite this, torpedoes remain highly vulnerable to missile interceptors due to their slow speed and work better when launched with large numbers of lower wield missiles in order to increase the chances of a successful delivery."
