  "content": "As far as we can tell from our skirmishes with the Hegemon, they are not actually human but artificial constructs with a humanoid form. Their source is a cause of great debate, but the prevailing theory is that they've come from the Hyperscape and are the product of one of the many unshackled AIs that exist in that domain. \n\nWhatever their source is, they are intent on creating a foothold within our galaxy and expand from there. To date, Imperial engagements with a Hegemon fleet have failed catastrophically, resulting in the loss of all hands. \n\nThe Hegemon ships are extremely advanced, technologically superior even to the Iriani. They rely heavily on anti-proton weaponry, which has proven to be devastating against our ships. Current Imperial protocol is to avoid engagement if at all possible until more advanced ships can be fielded, but it is highly unlikely we'll be capable of replicating their weaponry in a reasonable timescale."
