  "content": "Although the Empire has been technologically behind factions such as the Ascent or Iriani, they still produce the occasional breakthrough which has not been replicated by others. The Phase Barrier is such an advancement, where the theory behind a ship's hyperspace jump core is turned towards defense. \n\nThe phase barrier is a projected hyperspace aperture rather than a shield in the traditional sense. Projectiles and energy weapons don't exactly collide against it, but are instead shunted into hyperspace rather than continuing their trajectory in real space, allowing the the defending ship to trivially avoid incoming fire. \n\nThis nascent technology is clearly promising but still has years of development before it can be mass produced for all Imperial ships. The projected field still only covers a fraction of the ship and it loses coherence after short period, requiring careful timing and positioning from the Captain."
