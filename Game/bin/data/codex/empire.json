  "content": "The Empire was established several millennia ago, growing to encompass the entire galaxy. But with such expansion also came strife and the occasional rebellion, which eventually threatened the integrity of the galaxy-spanning Empire. \n\nFour centuries ago, the Imperial fleets found themselves spread too thin to effectively put down several rebellions and independence claims, leading towards a domino effect known as The Collapse. With the galaxy splintering into ever smaller factions and without the security provided by the Imperial fleets to protect the major trade routes, many sectors suffered catastrophic loss of life as much of the technology they relied on could no longer be maintained. \n\nHowever, the embers of the Empire have been relit in recent years, and a new expansion is starting with the goal of bringing back to the fold everything that has been lost, and restore the Empire to the height of its might."
