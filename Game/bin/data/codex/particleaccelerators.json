  "content": "Although technically both lances and ion cannons are particle accelerators, if you ever hear Fleet Command shout about the presence of a Particle Accelerator in the sector they are talking about a weapon considerably more devastating. \n\nConsiderably larger than an ion cannon, the particle accelerator accumulates energy over a long period of time into built-in capacitors, which power a state-of-the-art isochronous cyclotron to accelerate a triplet of uranium atoms to near-light speeds. The variable magnetic fields needed to contain the atoms at these speeds are so strong that they cause considerable structural stress to nearby modules. \n\nThe massive amount of kinetic energy stored in the uranium triplet cannot be absorbed by any known armour and a well aimed shot against an unshielded vessel will slice it from stern to prow, making it the only known weapon capable of destroying a dreadnought in a single shot. \n\nShields fare somewhat better, as rather than fully absorbing the blow, they will deflect the triplet away from the ship. However, this still puts an enormous strain on the shield generators and will almost certainly collapse after a couple of hits. This leaves the defending ship with only a couple of ways to survive a particle accelerator: a phase barrier, which shunts the particles into hyperspace, or by avoiding being in the line of fire in the first place."
