  "content": "The Unaligned Sectors don't exist as a single entity, but exist as the collection of any sector that is not under the control of any of the major factions. \n\nThese are sectors which have slowly been decaying since the collapse of the Empire, with limited trade routes and often locked in conflict with their neighbours over limited resources or access to more specialised technology. \n\nNo matter the history of each sector, they are all shadows of what they used to be and usually only capable of fielding old ships with limited capabilities. Still, this does not mean they are harmless and they can pose a threat to more modern Imperial ships if fielded in sufficiently high numbers."
