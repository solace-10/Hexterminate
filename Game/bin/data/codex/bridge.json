  "content": "This tall, normally heavily armoured module houses a spaceship's command crew, as well as the hyperspace core. The heart of the ship, it is connected to every other module via standardised interfaces. \n\nGiven its critical importance, it is often the primary target in combat and classical doctrine has the bridge surrounded by additional armour modules to increase the ship's survivability. \n\nThe bridge itself contains stations for every major department: Command, Navigation, Sensors and Combat. Secondary stations are not usually manned as those systems are under automated control of Expert Systems, but can be crewed in an emergency. \n\nThe hyperspace core is installed under the bridge, allowing the ship transit through the Hyperscape. Through careful calculations, a ship can dip into the Hyperscape and come out of it in a completely different location in real space, allowing for apparent faster-than-light travel."
