  "content": "Powered armour has multiple layers of an energised, segmented membrane with remarkable energy dissipation capabilities. These properties make it resistant to most energy weapons, such as lances or ion cannons, while still providing protection against classic kinetic weaponry.\n\nEasily spotted by the blue sheen triggered on impact, powered armour is often installed in Ascent or Iriani ships."
