  "content": "The antiproton cannon is a Hegemon development which is for the most part unmatched by weaponry of other factions. \n\nGenerating a minute amount of antimatter and enveloping it in a delicately balanced magnetic field before firing it at an enemy vessel, the antiproton cannon is a marvel of engineering. When the containment field is breached (usually by hitting the target ship), antimatter and matter annihilate each other, generating a large amount of energy which cannot by withstood by any known materials. \n\nThe antimatter containment field is slow enough that it will go past shields without being blocked, making this a devastating weapon even in a skirmish with technologically advanced factions. An additional module, called an Alternator, allows a ship to magnetically charge its shields and disrupt the containment field before it makes contact with the ship."
