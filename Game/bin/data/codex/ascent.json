  "content": "The Ascent, as a faction, predate the formation of the Empire. During the First Imperial Era, the Ascent formed the primary alliance standing against the Imperial expansion, until an experimental Imperial weapon turned their home sector's star into a supernova. \n\nResistance collapsed shortly afterwards. \n\nHowever, in the intervening centuries, the Ascent have managed to rebuild their presence and technology base. Preferring a large number of small but powerful strike fleets, their ships rely on energy weapons and wolf pack tactics. Heavily shielded, it can be challenging to destroy even their lighter gunships without bringing them to a stop first. \n\nCurrently in an expansion cycle, the Ascent are one of the main factions that threaten the existence of the Empire."
