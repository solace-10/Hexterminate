  "content": "The ramming prows are extremely heavy armour plates which are backed with a high-grade inertial dampener, which greatly reduces the damage received from performing ramming manoeuvers, while ensuring maximal transfer of kinetic energy into the enemy ship. \n\nDue to the forces involved, ramming prows are usually only available in the heavier, 400mm armour variant. The module's weight is made even more considerable due to the high density plates used for ramming, as well as the inertial dampener. \n\nThis incredible weight noticeably drags ships down, reducing manoeuvrability unless offset by more powerful engines. Additionally, ramming prows are not necessarily as resistant to incoming fire as dedicated armoured modules. \n\nThis module is a common sight on Marauder ships, which tend to prefer brawling over anything resembling proper void warfare."
