  "content": "When missiles are flying towards your hull, shields serve no use. Your only choice is to stay out of their range, or install a Missile Interceptor defense system. \n\nThese missile interceptors use a high intensity laser beam to detonate the missile's warhead before impact, powered by the ship's main reactors. The beam tracks a missile via a set of rotating mirrors housed inside a protective dome, providing full, 360 degree coverage against incoming ordenance. \n\nDespite how reliable such interceptor systems are, they can still be overwhelmed by large numbers of missiles or by the use of decoys. \n\nMore advanced missile interceptors can charge the laser's capacitors more quickly, allowing for a higher rate of fire. Some variants also include an upgraded sensor suite, improving their ability to ignore decoys and target the live missile."
