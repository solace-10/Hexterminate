  "content": "Engine Disruptors fire a small number of lightweight NNEMP (Non-Nuclear Electro-Magnetic Pulse) munitions which generate large electromagnetic shockwaves. These devices create a highly specific wave shape on a narrow frequency designed to disrupt the functioning of modern engines, greatly slowing down any ships which are caught within the blast radius. \n\nThis makes it an ideal defense against any fast moving flankers, or with the careful timing, reckless and dangerous ramming manoeuvres. However, the EMP is indiscriminate and will just as well affect allied ships or your own if they are caught in the blast radius. \n\nCertain engine modules have additional shielding, making them immune to engine disruptors. However, their reduced performance characteristics make them an uncommon sight."
