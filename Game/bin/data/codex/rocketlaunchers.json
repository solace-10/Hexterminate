  "content": "Rocket launchers are a turreted weapon system that delivers a high rate of rockets at a limited range which penetrates shields, dealing kinetic damage. \n\nRocket launchers overcome missile interceptor defenses by outputting a high volume of rockets in a short amount of time, by using smaller munitions tightly packed in the pod. Using fuel tanks substantially smaller than those seen in full-fledged missiles while keeping an equivalent warhead, the significantly shorter engagement range requires a ship to fully commit to the battle, but the resulting barrages will shred through most ships' armour. \n\nDespite their small effective range, most rockets have vectoring engines and are remarkably agile, making them virtually impossible to evade."
