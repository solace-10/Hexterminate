  "content": "High-calibre artillery pieces are some of earliest weapons to have been fitted to ships when Mankind made it to the stars. Their low rate of fire and turning speed were all but irrelevant until high-yield plasma engines increased the agility of capital ships, leading artillery pieces to slowly decrease in efficiency. \n\nHowever, they remain a popular choice for captains with limited resources, as there isn't a corner of the galaxy where these haven't been mass produced. \n\nHigher-end models do exist, innovating in the design of the auto-loaders, using higher grade materials capable of handling the enormous shearing forces applied by larger calibre cannons or using specialised, harder to manufacture shells. These advances come at steep energy costs, but the ability to dictate range even against the most technologically adept factions can make them viable choices in the hands of a capable captain."
