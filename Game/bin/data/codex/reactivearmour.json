  "content": "Reactive armour modules come in several variants, with the most common being Explosive Reactive Armour. Multiple layers of plating are interwoven with explosive charges, which detonate when a kinetic penetrator or shaped charge breach the plating. The resulting explosion and shift in the internal plating greatly decrease the amount of damage received by the module. \n\nThis type of armour is easily spotted by the red flashes generated when the module is impacted and it is most commonly seen in Marauder ships, particularly on the forward section."
