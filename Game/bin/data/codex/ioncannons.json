  "content": "Ion cannons are large beam weapons which accelerate positively charged hydrogen atoms to near-light speed, applying damage instantaneously and with perfect accuracy. \n\nIon cannons are built to fire continuously, consuming prodigious amounts of energy to sustain the beam. In turn, this generates vast amounts of heat which needs to be quickly dissipated. \n\nBetween the isochronous cyclotron and the oversized heatsinks, the weight is too great for a turret mount. Instead, the weapon is installed on a static spinal hardpoint, often being the main weapon in assault ships large enough to sustain the steep energy requirements. \n\nAdditionally, the ionisation effects of the beam puts considerable strain on most shielding technologies, with some especially tuned versions being capable of triggering catastrophic cascades on the target's shields, rendering them useless for prolonged periods of time."
