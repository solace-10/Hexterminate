  "content": "Deflector Shields are the standard shield modules used by spaceships, absorbing a reasonable amount of damage while being capable of regenerating in battle. \n\nAs virtually all current shield technology, it can only block high velocity projectiles and energy beams, still allowing through slower moving missiles or torpedoes. \n\nThe cyclic generator keeps strengthening the shield even while under fire and in the even of a shield bubble collapse, it is capable of restoring it within a minute. \n\nNote that installing multiple shield modules on a single ship has diminishing returns."
