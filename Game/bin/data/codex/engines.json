  "content": "Despite our ability to travel through the hyperscape, travel at sub-light speeds in normal space requires conventional engines. \n\nThese engine modules provide forward, lateral and angular thrust in differing amounts based on the specific design. Further modifications to the engines allow for short-term overloading for ramming or evasive manoeuvres, as well as additional shielding against EMP blasts. \n\nThese modules have to be balanced against the ship's mass, as a single engine will not be able to provide the necessary output to shift a capital vessel. High power-to-mass designs are possible, creating even dreadnaughts that can be surprisingly agile, even if they all but need a complete rebuild after a few years due to the massive structure stress they suffer as a result."
