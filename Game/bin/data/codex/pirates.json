  "content": "During the First Imperial Era, copyright infringement somehow became synonymous with piracy. Tired of being accused of piracy without having any of the benefits, a number of groups turned into real piracy. \n\nCenturies later, the galaxy is filled with pirate fleets looking for trade ships or smaller colonies to raid. Their ships usually have remarkably high power-to-weight ratios, allowing for fast strikes and equally quick escapes before additional fleets can be called from neighbouring sectors. \n\nAchieving this necessitates that pirate ships bear little to no armour, relying primarily on shields and their speed to keep them safe. \n\nTo this day, SCIHUB remains reachable, using a distributed network hosted by the various pirate fleets."
