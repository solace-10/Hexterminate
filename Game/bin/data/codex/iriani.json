  "content": "Throughout the collapse of the Empire, a region of space managed to remain relatively unscathed and would eventually unify itself into what has become known as the Iriani Federation. Large enough to maintain the trade inter-dependency which sustains modern civilisation, the Iriani kept advancing technologically throughout the centuries. \n\nThey are the largest threat to the resurgent Empire, with technologically superior fleets and capable of deploying inhibitors which prevent hyperspace travel for hostile forces within their sectors. Engagements between the Empire and the Iriani almost always result in an Imperial loss, barring a few instances where a single Iriani ship was isolated and ambushed. These cases, although rare, have allowed the recovery of several modules and provided the Empire with substantial technological leaps."
