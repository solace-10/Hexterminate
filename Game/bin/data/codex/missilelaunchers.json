  "content": "Missile launchers are a turreted weapon system that launches shield penetrating, guided missiles with kinetic damage payloads. These chemical-powered missiles have some of the longest ranges of any weapon, allowing for unparalleled damage application against ships unprotected by interceptor systems. \n\nDue to their size and fire rate, missiles are manufactured using an internal fabricator, allowing a ship to remain fielded for extended periods of time without having to be resupplied. \n\nLaunching the missiles requires minimal energy as they are self-propelled, freeing the reactors' output to be used by other, more demanding modules."
