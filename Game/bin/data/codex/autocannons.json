  "content": "An autocannon is a fully automatic weapon capable of firing relatively small calibre shells at short ranges. Other than chemical missiles, autocannons are some of the earliest examples of ship-to-ship weaponry and have remained relevant throughout the centuries despite technological advancements in armour plating and shielding. \n\nAutocannons are regularly installed in turrets, magnetically levitated to allow for high traversal rates. Their fire rate is usually limited by the risk of catastrophic overheating or mechanical failure of the reloading mechanisms. \n\nAlthough normally preferred by lower technology factions such as the Unaligned Sectors or the Marauders, there are exceptions to this trend and the existence of highly advanced autocannons is known of, which make use of exotic meta-materials and designs more commonly seen in railguns to load and fire shells at staggering rates. \n\nThe shells used by autocannons deal kinetic damage and the high fire rate somewhat reduces the advantages provided by reactive armour as the sheer volume of fire guarantees the target module will be damaged to some degree. However, their short range often means fully committing to an engagement."
