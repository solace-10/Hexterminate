  "content": "The Marauders (original name: expunged) are a fiercely independent group, having opposed the Empire's expansion and greatly resisting integration once conquered. \n\nIn recent decades they have become a concern for the Empire, leading to substantial skirmishes in controlled space. They have recently gained the ability to field sizeable fleets, usually composed of heavily armoured, slow moving capital ships. \n\nHowever, their apparent slowness has cost many Imperial captain their ships: their engines are rigged well beyond safety limits and the ramming prows are most definitely not ornamental."
