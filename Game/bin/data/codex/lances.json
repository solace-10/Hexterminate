  "content": "A Lance is a particle-beam weapon which shares a great deal of common ground with the Ion Cannon. Trading off the ability for sustained fire for being able to be mounted on a turret hardpoint, the Lance can provide long distance damage application with pinpoint accuracy. \n\nAn isochronous cyclotron accelerates hydrogen ions to a near-light speeds. Alternating-gradient focusing keeps the beam collimated to considerable distances, making Lances an ideal skirmishing weapon given a ship with substantial energy reserves. \n\nLances are often seen in more advanced cultures, with most Ascent and Iriani ships being configured with multiple Lance modules. The Empire has also been looking into this technology and has several prototypes, although Imperial scientists have struggled to replicate the beam coherency of their more advanced neighbours."
